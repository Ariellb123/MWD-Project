      Blog #1 | HTML Tags <br>
      Date | 2/09/21 <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
      <br>
      The topic that we learned about consisted of several HTML tags. We specifically went over the "a" tag, as it is used to define a hyperlink within a webpage. <br>
      <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
      <br>
      This topic will be very useful going forward because a tag like this is considered to be a building block of every website.Knowing this, it would be interesting to find a website that didn't involving using an "a" tag. <br>
           <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      It was not very difficult to work on this weeks topic. It gave me a good experience of what to expect throughout the rest of the class, assignment and project wise.  <br>

      Blog #2 | The 'div' Tag <br>
      Date | 2/11/21 <br>
       <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
      The 'div' is an essential tag to format a webpage.  It allows you to make vertical divisions for sections on a webpage. The "div" tag allows you to define your own class with various attributes. The "div" class consists of different classes such as background-color, border, and text-align. <br>
       <br>
     Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward]<br>
       <br>
 Formatting will be useful going forward, as it will be needed for for making an eye-catching website. Considering that the 'div' tag allows the user to have control over the vertical formatting, it would be left in the hands of the designer to make it as readable as possible.<br>
    <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      I can say that the topic this week was interesting to work on, as it showed progression on the difficulty level. It gave me a few ideas on what the do for different website ideas I had when practicing with it on w3schools.<br>

      Blog #3 | Audio/Video Tags <br>
      Date | 2/16/21-2/18/21 <br>
     <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
      We learned about audio and video tags this week. The audio tag isn't used often nowadays, but it allows one to place an audio file of different kinds of audio types, being an .mp3, .ogg, etc. The video tag, or 'iframe' tag makes embedding videos from other websites possible, while being able to alter the length and width dimensions of the iframe as well.<br>
     <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward]<br>
       <br>
      This will be useful going forward for my own project for this course, as I plan to incorperate different videos from YouTube into a website of my own. This will also be useful for future incorperations and enhancements.<br>
     <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      Tampering with the 'iframe' and 'audio' tag wasn't that bad to handle. Although I had a bit of trouble incorperating an .mp3 file for the audio portion, I eventually got the hang of it. The 'iframe' tag portion was the easier portion of the two to tamper with.<br>

      Blog #4 | Buttons <br>
      Date | 2/18/21 <br>
      <br>
       Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
 We went over the 'button' tag for todays' class. We learned that the button tag is used for creating clickable buttons for/on a webpage. It can be used to bring up text prompts on most web browsers.<br>
      <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
       <br>
This topic will be useful going forward, as it will be programmed into a future project for this class. For the pages that I plan to have for my project, I would want to be able to navigate at the "click" of a "button", if you catch my drift.<br>
       <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      This topic was a good one to work with. Incorperating buttons into webpages initially seemed difficult at first, but I ended up getting the hang of how it works. I tried using the button to send the user to the "Rick Rolled" video in my spare time, and that was pretty entertaining to do. <br>

      Blog #5 | Styles <br>
      Date | 2/23/21 <br>
       <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
      <br>
      This week, we went over the 'style' tag. We also learned how to style a webpage using different styling attributes. The tag gives the user the ability to alter aspects such as font color, font style, background color. <br>
       <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
       <br>
      This will be useful going forward when creating your own website. In order for it to be a great one, or at least decently eye-catching to many viewers, multiple factors of your website would have to be altered through the 'style' tag. This goes for when I create my own website for the upcoming project.<br>
      <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
       Going over this in class initially proved to be a bit challenging for me during class, but I plan on going it some practice for the next couple of days in order to get the hang of using it.  <br>

      Blog #6 | CSS  <br>
      Date | 2/25/21 <br>
       <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
     The topic was dwelled into was about 'CSS', or Cascading Style Sheets. It's known as a programming language that's used a lot in HTML files. It can create different classes for many aspects of HTML. 
      <br>
       <br>
     Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward]<br>
       <br>
       Using CSS going forward will be very essential when going deep into Web Design and Development. If I continue down the road that I am on, regarding this course and so on, then I believe that I can gain more info about the different uses of/for CSS, therefore allowing more progress to be made within this class and my project.<br>
       <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
     Thankfully, I took a course in my Freshmen year, being CS110:Introduction to Computers, so tampering with what we learned about CSS made what I learned from the CS course prior come back to mind. The reason being that we went over the basics of CSS,so it wasn't too bad for me this time around. <br>

      Blog #7 | CSS Selectors <br>
      Date | 3/04/21 <br>
      <br>
       Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
     This week, we went over 'CSS Selectors'. The selectors are pretty much patterns used to select the element(s) that you would want to personally style. <br>
      <br>
     Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
       <br>
      I think that using CSS Selectors will be useful going forward, as this will be beneficial when wanting to style different elements of your choosing with one selector. I have mentioned my project in other blog sections, but I will try to implement selectors if I need to for what I am trying to do.<br>
       <br>
        Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      Going over CSS selectors didn't seem to be too bad for me. The only thing that I would say had me comtemplating on using selectors in the future would be having to distinguish what selector is for the ids' that you use.<br>

      Blog #8 | Java Data Types <br>
      Date | 3/23/21 <br>
      <br>
      Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
The topic that we went over this week was about the basics of the JavaScript programming language. Specifically, we focused on the different variable types and definitions. Throughout this topic, we touched on integers, strings, lists, objects, and booleans.<br>
       <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
       <br>
      I think that this topic will be useful going forward, as it will be a progressive feat for me when finding the need to implement them on future assignments.Using these data types are important, as they can be considered as the backbone of JavaScript.  <br>
      <br>
       Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
I tried working with JavaScript on jsfiddle, and it honestly wasan interesting experience for me. I may not have too much intel on Java, but dwelling into the land of Java has me thoroughly interested in what's to come.<br>

      Date | 4/01/21 <br>
     <br>
       Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
      This week, we dove into how buttons can execute different CSS styles. We also touched on integrating JavaScript into a webpage, which can be done through functions. <br>
       <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward]<br>
       <br>
      I think that this topic will be useful going forward, as it can be a potential option to include within my project. Knowing that it can change different elements of a website, it would be a great implementation to my own. Even with JavaScript, having it makes it easy to go from one page to another, along with having displays for your own implementations, such as a video.<br>
      <br>
        Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      This topic in particular proved to be a challenge when I tried to tamper it. I attempted to make continuous buttons, which didn't end up well for me. Despite this, it wasn't too bad for me to get when discussed in class. <br>

      Blog #10 | Loops and Arrays <br>
      Date | 4/08/21 <br>
    <br>
       Q1 | [Explain what the topic is] <br>
       <br>
The topic for this week that we went over involved JavaScript conditions, loops and arrays. Arrays are known to be data structures that allow for data to be stored, and it can be used in different ways in JavaScript. Loops are considerably simple to use for having something done in a continuous manner, such as generating strings.<br>
     <br>
      Q2 | [Explain why you think the topic will be useful going forward] <br>
       <br>
      Arrays are going to be a very important part to creating efficient web pages since large amounts of data will be collected and stored. Prevously, without knowledge of JS arrays, we would have had to store each variable as it's own separate instance. Arrays allow for easy and quick organization of assiciated variables. Overall, arrays are used a lot in any other programming language that I have used, so I am sure that arrays in JS will be imperative to furthering my development of a web developer.
      
      I think that these topics will be very useful going forward, as using arrays and loops may be essential when working on my project. Specifically, if I need a set number to repeat itself on a certain page, or if I need differernt files to be stored in a specific spot.<br>
      <br>
      Q3 | [How difficult was it to work on this weeks topic] <br>
       <br>
      This topic was fairly easy for me since I have worked with arrays in almost all of my CS and data science courses throughout my time at UHart. Furthermore, arrays are a very simple data structure, so understanding their nature and operations was a very quick process. I enjoyed looking at arrays in a stack concept since the idea of stacks intruige me and I enjoy the multiple ways in which programming data structures can be interpreted. I am excited to get working with arrays in JS, especially as we begin our final projects for this course!
      
      Implementing arrays was a bit difficult, considering that it was something fairly new to me. Not having a good background with Java, in my perspective, hurts me, but I am glad to have had the chance to learn more about this topic. Going over conditions and loops was alright for me to go over.<br>
